description=This modpack is a curated list of mods that I use to alter the gameplay of Factorio. Several of the more gameplay altering mods are listed as optional dependencies.\n\nThis modpack introduces a couple of changes to the default configuration of the included mods. See the GitHub repo's README.md for detailed information.
